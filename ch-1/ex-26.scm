; Exercise 1.26. Louis Reasoner is having great difficulty doing exercise 1.24.
; His fast-prime? test seems to run more slowly than his prime? test. Louis
; calls his friend Eva Lu Ator over to help. When they examine Louis's code,
; they find that he has rewritten the expmod procedure to use an explicit
; multiplication, rather than calling square:

(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder (* (expmod base (/ exp 2) m)
                       (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
                    m))
        (else
         (remainder (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
                    m))))

; ``I don't see what difference that could make,'' says Louis. ``I do.'' says
; Eva. ``By writing the procedure like that, you have transformed the (log n)
; process into a (n) process.'' Explain.

; Each procedure call of Louis's expmod calls two more instead of one.
